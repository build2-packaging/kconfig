# kconfig-upstream

Upstream source code for the Linux kernel configuration system (Kconfig).

The `kconfig-upstream-<ver>` branches contain the C source code of the
configuration system from Linux kernel version `<ver>`. A number of patches
are applied on top in order to make Kconfig usable in other build systems, on
other platforms, etc. Some but probably not all of these patches will
hopefully make it upstream.
